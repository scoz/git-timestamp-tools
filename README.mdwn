publictimestamp.org for Git commits  

To start notarizing Git commits for a repo:

* Put `publictimestamp.jar` in a public place
* Edit `git-notarize` to point at `publictimestamp.jar`
* Put `git-notarize` in a public path
* Put the `post-commit` hook in `.git/hooks`
* Make sure `git-notarize` and `post-commit` are executable

Now, whenever you commit you should see extra text reporting
that the commit hash has been notarized at
[http://publictimestamp.org](http://publictimestamp.org). To
"verify" a commit hash, use

>     git-notarize --verify <commitish>

(with a committish that specifies a single commit).
